I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Machine Learning Genoa Center (MaLGa)](https://malga.unige.it/), Italy, where I work under the supervision of [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/). 

Until december 2023, I was a Ph.D student at the [Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/fr/), France. I completed my Ph.D under the supervision of [François Malgouyres](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~fmalgouy/) and [François Bachoc](https://francoisbachoc.github.io/).
